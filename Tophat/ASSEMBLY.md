Remove your top panel, keep the foam strip in the stock position | 
Remove the support strip from the "base" parts | 
Attach the base pieces to the printer using the roll-in nuts and m3x8 screws | 
Lay foam tape along the step in the base parts | 
Press the 6x3mm magnets into all parts, be mindful of polarity, I suggest keeping it all in the same direction. | 
Drive the m3x30 screws into each dowel pin | 
Assemble the "picture frame" using the dowel pins and super glue, hot glue is doable but very difficult | 
Place the "picture frame" on the printer and lay the vhb tape on the lower step in the "corner" and "edge" pieces| 
(out of the way of the foam strip of the top panel) | 
Place top panel onto the frame and press it into the VHB tape |
