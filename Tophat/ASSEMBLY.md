Remove your top panel, keep the foam strip in the stock position | *[intentionally left blank]*
Remove the support strip from the "base" parts | ![alt text](https://github.com/jakub874/Jakub3DPrinterMods/blob/main/Tophat/img/Screenshot%202023-01-28%20234559.png?raw=true)
Attach the base pieces to the printer using the roll-in nuts and m3x8 screws. The screws go into the holes in the base piece as pictured. | ![alt text](https://github.com/jakub874/Jakub3DPrinterMods/blob/main/Tophat/img/Screenshot%202023-01-28%20235321.png?raw=true)
Lay foam tape along the step in the base parts | [TODO: add image]
Press the 6x3mm magnets into the base piece into the holes as highlighted in the picture. It is recommended to keep them all the same polarity. | ![alt text](https://github.com/jakub874/Jakub3DPrinterMods/blob/main/Tophat/img/Screenshot%202023-01-28%20235627.png?raw=true)
Press the 6x3mm magnets into the frame pieces. It is recommended to keep these the same polarity, opposite of that of the base piece so that they attract. | ![alt text](https://github.com/jakub874/Jakub3DPrinterMods/blob/main/Tophat/img/Screenshot%202023-01-29%20000252.png?raw=true)
Drive the m3x30 screws into each dowel pin | *[intentionally left blank]*
Assemble the "picture frame" using the dowel pins and super glue, hot glue is doable but very difficult | ![alt text](https://github.com/jakub874/Jakub3DPrinterMods/blob/main/Tophat/img/Screenshot%202023-01-29%20000215.png?raw=true)
Place the "picture frame" on the printer and lay the vhb tape on the lower step in the "corner" and "edge" pieces. The foam strip already attached to the panel will rest on the small upper step. | ![alt text](https://github.com/jakub874/Jakub3DPrinterMods/blob/main/Tophat/img/Screenshot%202023-01-28%20234456.png?raw=true)
Place top panel onto the frame and press it into the VHB tape |
