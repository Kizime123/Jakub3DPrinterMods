# Printer Tophat

A tophat inspired by the Annex k3 Summit enclosure. Currently support VORON V1, V2, and Tiny-t 150.

If you want a version for a currently unsupported printer or just want a specific size PM me on Discord.

Also requires 8x of the dowel pin from the [Annex K3 Tophat Structure](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Gasherbrum-K3/blob/main/Release_1_1/STLs/Summit_Enclosure/Tophat/tophat_lid_structure_c_x8_rev3.STL)

## BOM
**Part** | **Count** | **Reduced***
--- | --- | ---
6x3 Magnet | 56 | 40
M3x8 SHCS | 24 | 16
M3 Roll-in Nut | 24 | 16
M3x30 SHCS | 8
1x5mm Foam Tape<br>*(voron standard)* | 1-2m**
1x5mm VHB Tape<br>*(6mm/.25in should work too)* | 1-2m**

*for smaller printers marked with "reduced BOM".<br>
**enough to do a loop around the top of the frame of the printer.

## ASSEMBLY
1. Remove your top panel, keep the foam strip in the stock position
2. Remove the support strip from the "base" parts
3. Attach the base pieces to the printer
4. Lay foam tape along the step in the base parts
5. Press the magnets into all parts, be mindeful of polarity, I suggest keeping it all in the same direction.
6. Drive the m3x30 screws into each dowel pin
7. Assemble the "picture frame" using the dowel pins and super glue, hot glue is doable but very difficult
8. Place the "picture frame" on the printer and lay the vhb tape on the lower step
9. Place top panel onto the frame and press it around the perimiter into the VHB tape
