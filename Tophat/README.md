# Printer Tophat

A tophat inspired by the Annex k3 Summit enclosure. Currently support VORON V1, V2, and Tiny-t 150.

If you want a version for a currently unsupported printer or just want a specific size PM me on Discord.

Also requires 8x of the dowel pin from the [Annex K3 Tophat Structure](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Gasherbrum-K3/blob/main/Release_1_1/STLs/Summit_Enclosure/Tophat/tophat_lid_structure_c_x8_rev3.STL)
